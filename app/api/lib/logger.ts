// debug a preview that will not start or a request that 500s. stdout is
// collected by the platform's log pipeline, but the agent inspects the sandbox
// directly (its shell and this process share one sandbox), so the two sinks
// are written from one call — same bytes in both.
//
// Zero dependencies on purpose: this file is grafted into every user project,
// so pulling in pino/winston would add weight to the template's dependency
// surface for a feature whose whole job is "append one JSON line".

// never lands in the user's workspace (that tree is git-archived and shipped at

//
// It is NOT "naturally bounded" — that was wishful. The rate limits in
// clientlog.ts cap the *browser* path per minute, but server lines, access-log
// lines and (in production) static-asset requests are not rate limited at all,
// so a busy preview can write gigabytes over a long session and fill the disk,
// turning a logging feature into a new outage class. Hence an explicit byte
// budget below: past it the file is truncated once, with a marker, so the newest
// evidence survives and the total stays bounded.
